#### velogical repair

recently my velogical light suddenly went out. i wasn't sure what was wrong. i
cut the wires to the thermistor and then just used a multimeter to figure out
if charge was being generated. after i was able to use multimeters to determine
that the dynamo was still producing current, i just replaced the thermistor,
and now we're back in business.
