# petioling

a song about a plant, an alien, and a video game.
the idea is that you're sitting under this tree, thinking about video games.
but a leaf falls next to you and becomes alive, yet digitized.
its not from this world. maybe its just a memory.

mostly made on mother32, subharmonicon, and digitakt. see [[gear]].
the samples come from [san soleil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans_Soleil).
its an item in my [[collections]].
