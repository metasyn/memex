# crosscut

<!--epistemic=sapling-->

this song was inspired and focuses around the concept of entering an underground passage in a video game.
there is such a trope, but one i love, of suddenly having to go into the sewers or the tunnels of a city
and finding the underworld there. it needs to be wet, somewhat windy, and of course full of new enemies.

i was thinking about the various games i've played that employed this theme and how they all have a certain
vibe. this is my take on it!
