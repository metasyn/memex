[https://metasyn.pw/sfshows](https://metasyn.pw/sfshows) was a project i started around 2014
to show where various venues are in the san francisco bay area. the shows are scraped from an
amazing resource: [The List](http://www.foopee.com/punk/the-list/). *the list* has been around
for quite some time, and does a great job listing a lot of shows in a pretty nice, simple,
accessible format.

however, i found myself forgetting which venues where which, and more importantly, which
ones were on my side of the bay (in san francisco usually). in order to map these resources,
i've manually entered all of the latitude and longitudes of various venues over the years:
