this day we focus on simply getting towards the coast. the road is almost 100% paved the entire way, which makes this a overall pretty easy and casual day. at roughly 30 miles, we will have ample time to stop and get coffee, lunch, or beers as needed.

the goal is to get to campground at Samuel P. Taylor campground. they have a hike and bike section, if you don't want to make reservations. it's a relatively small campground nestled into the side of the hill next to a creek. there are some walking paths near by we could check out too. it's really pretty, lush, and wet, but cold. you can tell right away when you're biking into and out of the area, so make sure to bring warm clothes, as the park is roughly 10 degrees colder (farenheit) usually than san rafael.

    this is our play day! we can bike to point reyes station, pick up some supplies if needed and get coffee, and make our way up towards marshall. the plan is to pick up oysters and have a picnic near millerton point. after that, we can head back to the campground before it gets dark to make dinner.

This is just the reverse of the first map, so I won't bother adding it here.
