## weather

The weather on Vancouver Island seems pretty temprate around this time of year.
Historically, the lows are in the 50's and the highs are in the 70's. Generally
these months have 7-10 days worth of rain, so there is a reasonable chance it
might rain on us, but if that is case, we'll just make the best of it.
