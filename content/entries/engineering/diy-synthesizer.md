below are notes on building my own synthesizer from scratch.

# sanfreo-euroling

i attended the diy synthesizer workshop from [dogbotic](https://dogbotic.com/). the course covers an informal introduction to [[electrical-engineering]] as well as introduction to various basic circuits for building synthesizers with simple [[integrated-circuits]]. this was what i created at the end of the class! see the [[sanfreo-euroling]] page for information on what it was, looks like, and the schematic.
