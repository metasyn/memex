# engineering characters

below are a list of engineering **characters**. they're characters in the sense
that they've intrigued, inspired, or otherwise stuck out to me, and generally,
are people i have never met.

- [philip guo](https://pg.ucsd.edu/) -  guo's research on human computer
  interaction, and and how we learn to use technology is fascinating, and he
  has made some neat tools around learning different software related things -
  a bunch for [[python]]. also his lectures just make him seem like a really
  nice smart humble guy.

- [drew devault](https://drewdevault.com/) - drew's commitment to FOSS (free
  and open source software) is admirable, and sometimes intimidating. he
  created [sourcehut](https://sr.ht), of which i am a contributor and proudly
  paying supporter.  i host this [[memex]] on sourcehut, as well as pretty much
  all my other code.

- [devine lu linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/) - devine is a curious soul who
  inspires me like few others. i am thankful to have met him on the internet
  after getting interested in his project orca. for orca, i made a
  tutorial/sandbox site [[learn-orca]] after becoming intrigued. later, i did
  the same for one of his uxn project - [[learn-uxn]]. the technology and
  philosophy that accompany his online persona are worth checking out - also
  see [[solarpunk]] and [[permacomputing]].

- [dan luu](https://danluu.com/) - i enjoy his thoughts on technology, computer
  science, industry, learning, and writing. more generally though reading dan's
  post is always fun, and he is humble and funny.

- [julia evans](https://jvns.ca/) - i love julias comics. i learn something
  every time i read them as well! julia reminds me to stay curious and keep
  learning and also not be intimidated by things that feel insurmountable.
  reading some of her zines reminds me that troubleshooting and debugging and
  investing in tooling around that is time well spent.

- [andrew kelley](https://andrewkelley.me/) - andrew kelley is creating the zig
  language. if you get a chance to watch some of his videos on how and why zig
  is the way it is, its inspiring to see such someone setting their sights on
  longevity, security, maintainability, and also being capable and dedicated
  enough to make it happen. i haven't learned zig yet but the more i read/watch
  from andrew, i feel like its just a matter of time until i at least try to on
  some level.

- [richard littauer](https://www.burntfen.com/) - richard littauer is great -
  and one of the few people i know who studied computational linguistics
  _before_ moving into software and engineering. his work is wide ranging and
  worth exploring - i appreciate reading about his journey into open source and
  his work with [open source collective](https://www.oscollective.org/)

- [xe iaso](https://xeiaso.net/) - the depth of xe's blog posts into somewhat
  obscure and interesting parts of technology is remarkable. i also appreciate
  their honesty and ability to be self aware, as well as candidness around
  their career and plurality.

- [amos wenger](https://fasterthanli.me/) - rust focused didactic long form
  conversational blog posts. these take a long time to read but they're
  incredibly fun to go through. i learn something interesting everytime i read
  amos's posts and enjoy his story of how he got into programming.
