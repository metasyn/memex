# engineering characters

below are a list of engineering **characters**. they're characters in the sense
that they've intrigued, inspired, or otherwise stuck out to me, and generally,
are people i have never met.

- [philip guo](https://pg.ucsd.edu/) - i was exposed to philip guos teachings
  sometime in college, especially when i got my first computer related job at a
  graduate school for education. simultaneously, i was studying TESOL,
  programming languages, and second language acquisition. philip guo's research
  on human computer interaction, how humans understand computers, and how we
  learn to use technology is fascinating, and he has made some neat tools
  around learning different things. also his lectures just make him seem like a
  really nice smart humble guy.

- [drew devault](https://drewdevault.com/) - drew's commitment to FOSS (free
  and open source software) is admirable, and sometimes intimidating. he
  created [sourcehut](https://sr.ht), of which i am a contributor and proudly
  paying supporter. drews projects are varied and interesting from texas
  instruments z80 calculator operating systems, to new programming languages
  like hare, to commerical ventures like sourcehut - all with intense
  dedication to foss principles and ethics. he reminds me for some reason of
  richard stallman (in the good way, whatever that means to you).

- [devine lu linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/) - devine is a curious soul who
  inspires me like few others. i am thankful to have met him on the internet
  after getting interested in his project orca. for orca, i made a
  tutorial/sandbox site [[learn-orca]] after becoming intrigued. later, i did
  the same for one of his uxn project - [[learn-uxn]]. devine's impact on me
  has been considerable, and the technology and philosophy that accompany his
  online persona are worth checking out.

- [dan luu](https://danluu.com/) - i've accidentally stumbled across dan luu's
  blog posts a number of times, and spent quite some reading them. i enjoy his
  takes on technology and computer science, as well as his candid approach to
  talking about his own career in tech.

- [julia evans](https://jvns.ca/) - i love julias comics. i learn something
  every time i read them as well! julia reminds me to stay curious and keep
  learning and also not be intimidated by things that feel insurmountable.
  especially when i first started learning networking and linux, i feel like
  reading some of her zines reminded me that troubleshooting and debugging and
  investing in tooling around that is time well spent.

- [andrew kelley](https://andrewkelley.me/) - andrew kelley is creating the zig
  language. if you get a chance to watch some of his videos on how and why zig
  is the way it is, its inspiring to see such someone setting their sights on
  longevity, security, maintainability, and also being capable and dedicated
  enough to make it happen. i haven't learned zig yet but the more i read/watch
  from andrew, i feel like its just a matter of time until i at least try to on
  some level.

- [richard littauer](https://www.burntfen.com/) - richard littauer is great -
  and one of the few people i know who studied computational linguistics
  _before_ moving into software and engineering. his work is wide ranging and
  worth exploring.

- [xe iaso](https://xeiaso.net/)
