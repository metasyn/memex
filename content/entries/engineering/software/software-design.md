# software design

i enjoy learning about [[computer-science-history]], [[programming-languages]], and [[characters]] in computing, but also about how software can be built today to ensure robust, maintainable, usable systems. below are books, sites, and essays that have disproportionately affected my views.

## books

- a philosophy of software design - john ousterhout
- design patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented software - also known simply as "design patterns". the four authors are known as the "gang of four" (GoF) often (which is actually a historical reference to the [gang of four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four) in maoist communist history.

## essays

- [software disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) - a fabulous essay on the bloat, ridiculousness, and general depravity of modern software as well as the development process - and generally how bad things have become
- [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud) - this design pattern is kind of amazing. there is a tongue-in-cheek element to the essay but it is actually a pattern that you see in large companies and enterprise software more generally. its amazing to know that this pattern has continued to be witnessed since 1997. you can read the wikipedia page on this anti-pattern [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud)
