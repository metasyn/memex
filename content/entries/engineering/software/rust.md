# rust

i started learning rust sometime around 2020. having spent a while slowly learning about the benefits of static typing, the idea of statically analyzed memory safety while ensuring strong/static typing seemed pretty interesting.

## resources on learning rust

- https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen/How_to_learn_modern_Rust
- https://blessed.rs/crates - popular and common utility crates to know and use since rust does a decent job at trying to keep the standard library lean
