# degoogle

> there is no cloud; only other people's computers

at one point, i realized how many different parts of my life were somehow
intertwined with google's services. while i don't deny their usefulness, as
they saying goes, if you don't pay for the product, you are the product. and i
started thinking more about how to actually move my data and usage off their
services. interestingly, this is part of a bigger grassroots movement: [degoogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle).
i'm far from being finished - because some of the services still make
sense for me to use. but i am attempting to at least slowly move my online self
off of their services. if you have particular suggestions, please do [[contact]]
me for how to continue getting off of google's services.

there are lots of lists out there that go over alternatives:

- https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/

below, some notes on things i have and haven't switched off.

# successes

## gmail

<details>

i decided to start paying for encrypted mail at [protonmail](protonmail.com).
however, after having used my previous email at gmail for almost two decades,
the switch is far from being finished. but getting started is half done! by
paying for it, i was also able to now use a custom domain when i give my email
out. this allows me to later decide to change off protonmail if i want, without
having to change my email.

</details>

## google chrome

<details>

i use firefox for 99% of my personal browsing, but often am required to use
chrome for the occasional chrome-only website, or for work.

</details>

## google drive

<details>

i started a [nextcloud](nextcloud.com) server - but i still need to set up
automatic backups. the server, as a whole, has a weekly autoback up that is
easy enough to use in the meantime.

</details>

## google calendar

<details>

[nextcloud](nextcloud.com) also has a contact and calendar functionality
which i sync to phone using [davx5](https://www.davx5.com/). this has been
surprisingly easy actually!

</details>

## google authenticator

<details>

i switched to using [aegis](https://getaegis.app/).

</details>

## google reader

<details>

haha, google already killed this product. i use [feedly](feedly.com).

</details>

# partials

## youtube

<details>

youtube has a clear monopoly on content, as well as content creators.
while there are tools like [invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/),
or [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) (which i use) - they only partially
disconnect you with the youtube platform itself.

i'm aware of [peertube](https://peer.tube/videos/trending?a-state=42) but
have not really found that there is a ton of content that i am after there.
often when i do find a video, the speeds are so poor its hard to use.
however i am happy to see the development's that [framasoft](https://framasoft.org/en/)
are making towards a [decentralized search](https://joinpeertube.org/) across
peertube instances.

</details>

## google search

<details>

i actually don't have a good replacement for this. i've been trying to use
[ecosia](ecosia.org) for a while, but for technical information, or hyper local
information, i find that google search is hard to beat. i'm ok with this for
the time being. i also tried using DuckDuckGo for quite some time, and still
use it sometimes, but am hoping that someday,
[we can do better than DuckDuckGo](https://drewdevault.com/2020/11/17/Better-than-DuckDuckGo.html).

recently, i was suggested to give [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com/en/about-us) a try.
i did give it a try but overall wasn't super impressed.

</details>

## google maps

<details>

i tried using open street maps for android, and frankly, it is far from
comparable. i still use google maps all the time. i would like to find a
reasonable alternative. while open street maps works to some degree, it
doesn't really have the business information i often rely on google maps for. i
don't think there is a simple solution here yet for me.

i am excited about [maps.earth](https://about.maps.earth) though!

</details>

# failures

## google android more generally

<details>

i used cyanogen mod for about 8 years before more recently switching back to stock
(pixel) android. i'd like to consider switching to something like

- [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/about/)
- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)

or even the newer version of cyanogen:

- [LineageOS](https://grapheneos.org/)

</details>

## google fi

<details>

i use google fi for my phone plan. this one is easy to change, so i have been
putting it off. for some reason, i'm not exactly sure why, i kind of care about
this one the least. it feels like there aren't a ton of good alternatives in
general.

one recent one that i saw that caught my eye was PGPP:

- [INVISV: Pretty Good Phone Privacy (PGPP)](https://invisv.com/pgpp/)

</details>

## google photos

<details>

google photos i think has been one of the harder ones for me. i've looked at
some alternatives but simply organizing photos is such a royal pain imo.
however, out of all the services, this is the one i'd like to tackle the most.
i set up a sync to nextcloud using the nextcloud app from my phone, but it
ends up failing quite a bit and isn't super reliable.

i've considered running [photo prism](https://photoprism.app) but probably need to
rent or run an additional server in order to run something like that.
