the things we read, that somehow stick with us, more than they might.

> By convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by

- Democritus

> All media in which you can work directly with the sounds have more in common
> with any other than with traditional European techniques of working with

- Laurie Spiegel - from [The Expanding Universe](retiary.org/expanding_universe)

> Now it seems most machines are square - their design has a goal, to create

> "Progress means: humanity emerges from its spellbound state no longer under

- Ursula K. Le Guinn (The Dispossesed)

> to be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. it is based on
> the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of
> compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. what we choose to emphasize in this
> complex history will determine our lives. if we see only the worst, it destroys
> our capacity to do something. if we remember those times and places—and there
> are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy
> to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in
> a different direction. and if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have
> to wait for some grand utopian future. the future is an infinite succession of
> presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of
> all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.

- howard zinn

> therefore there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange
> of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subordination.
> this same reason forbids me, then, to recognise a fixed, constant and
> universal authority, because there is no universal man, no man capable of
> grasping in all that wealth of detail, without which the application of
> science to life is impossible, all the sciences, all the branches of social
> life.


- mikhail bakunin - what is authority? 1870
