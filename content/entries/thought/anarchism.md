# anarchism

> darling, i've told you several times before. i have no dream job. i do not dream of labor.

## readings

> by anarchist spirit i mean that deeply human sentiment, which aims at the good of all, freedom and justice for all, solidarity and love among the people; which is not an exclusive characteristic only of self-declared anarchists, but inspires all people who have a generous heart and an open mind.

—Errico Malatesta, Umanita Nova, April 13, 1922
