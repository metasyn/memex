# lifestyle environmentalism

> ... from classical liberalism to contemporary neoliberalism, it is the so called free and voluntary trade between buyers and sellers that remains the ideological core of the capitalist hegemony

- matt huber, climate change as class war

lifestyle environmentalism is the belief that your individual actions, in
particular your consumptive habits and practices, is both the driving force and the solution to ecological issues and climate change more generally. more generally, it seeks to improve the world by focusing our actions on _individual_ actions rather than collective ones, and operates at the level of individuals.

in contrast, more radical climate movements, such as [extinction rebellion](https://rebellion.global/),
makes demands like "system change, not climate change", and focus on collective
actions rather than actions that revolve around individual (often consumerist)
behaviors.

often point towards various versions of this: we all need to do our part, some
actions are better than others, or maybe its really just the uber-wealthy that
are the problem. however all of these approaches still focus on the actions of
the individual: if _you_ recycle more, if _they_ fly less, if _i_ stop eating
meat. some articles
([1](https://www.science.org/content/article/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about))
even bend towards [neomalthusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism),
suggesting not having children in order to reduce your carbon footprint.

## carbon guilt

the entire concept of a carbon footprint was coined by british petroleum in the
early 2000's. now you can pay people to calculate your exact carbon footprint
and quantify exactly how bad you should feel for your lifestyle, and exactly
how good when you reduce your carbon footprint by X amount. while i have no
problem with quantification, or with reducing your carbon footprint, the fact
that the concept was literally coined by fossil fuel companies to **distract us**
from their own systemic connection to climate change is worth keeping in mind.
underlying the concept of carbon guilt is an implicit belief in and near
moral reification of [consumer sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_sovereignty).
this, in conjunction with some belief in the "invisible hand of the market",
dissolve us of needing to question or dismantle the systems the present our
limited options: would you like spearmint or wintermint plastic toothpaste tubes?
in contrast, we could be (correctly) blaming those that needlessly profit
from our need to live, and our our requirements for housing, food,
water, energy, and so on, rather than blaming ourselves.
