# ethics

i think this wording is well put, and something i align with:

> we are committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. to undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. to subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. to actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking. to look inside and face these parts of our darkness, personal and collective, and come out of it with more kindness and compassion. we strive to use our platform to offer connection, solidarity, and support with marginalized folks — people of colour, trans, non-binary, and queer people, disabled folks, women, and people living at the intersections of these identities — and to give back to our communities, local and abroad.
