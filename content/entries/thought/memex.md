# memex

## the original memex
>  The memex is the name of the hypothetical proto-hypertext system that
   Vannevar Bush described in his 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article "As We May
   Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would
   compress and store all of their books, records, and communications,
   "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and
   flexibility". The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to
   one's memory".

## zettelkasten

another similar one, also analog, but more methodological:

> A zettelkasten consists of many individual notes with ideas and other short
  pieces of information that are taken down as they occur or are acquired. The
  notes are numbered hierarchically, so that new notes may be inserted at the
  appropriate place, and contain metadata to allow the note-taker to associate
  notes with each other. For example, notes may contain tags that describe key
  aspects of the note, and they may reference other notes. The numbering,
  metadata, format and structure of the notes is subject to variation depending
  on the specific method employed.

## commonplaces

interestingly there are also similar physical concepts:

> Commonplace books (or commonplaces) are a way to compile knowledge, usually
  by writing information into books. They have been kept from antiquity, and
  were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century.
  Such books are essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind:
  recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs,
  prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students,
  and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is
  unique to its creator's particular interests but they almost always include
  passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler's
  responses. They became significant in Early Modern Europe.

## digital gardens

another way of talking about the same concept that i have seen in various places
on the web are the idea of a digital garden. where rather than a museum, a gallery,
a portfolio, or a journal - it's a place where you can tend to ideas to watch them
grow, and share with other's if they want to visit. i like the idea more generally,
as it seems like it strikes a really reasonable balance between the external and
internal worlds we live in. futher more, the concept of coming back to the same
idea (i.e. page, theory, writing, notes, etc) and adding to that at a later date
is also antithetical to the fast consumption we're used to online. the same
essay doesn't have to stay the same. it's ok to update things - or to rip things
out when space is needed for other things to grow.

## writing your own

there are many tools that already exist that help people try to organize their
thoughts in similar ways - but there is also value in figuring it out for
yourself.  similarly, there are ton of options out there for static site
generators. at least for me, i see value in often doing something for yourself,
even if there is an easier way. like gardening, or riding your bike maybe.

this iteration is my first attempt at sharing ideas in this manner. i spent a lot of time
thinking about how i could plan for longevity while also keeping the writing process simple.
i settled on just plain text (markdown) that gets rendered via a simple script in nim.
