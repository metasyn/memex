# epistemic disclosure

epistemic diclosure is the practice of disclosing your certainty, conviction, background, and origin knowledge about some information. the majority of the information on my site
is rather casual, links to notes or other sites, however, i've slowly begun to add more essays and personal opinions onto the site. there are also pages where my knowledge is clearly
lacking, or othertimes, where i feel something strongly but feel it is based on substance. the practice of of providing epistemic tags to pages is practiced across a lot wiki's and
memexes. examples:

- [devon zuegel](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing)
- [jake bauer](https://www.paritybit.ca/garden/digital-garden-philosophy.html)
- [maggie appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/epistemic-disclosure)

Another approach I like is from a [[character|characters]] [xe iaso](https://xeiaso.net/blog/) who adds the following to many pages:

> This article was posted on <date>. Facts and circumstances may have changed since publication. Please contact me before jumping to conclusions if something seems wrong or unclear.

While a catchall like that does potentially help, I personally felt more drawn to symbols that relate to a combination of epistemic effort and epistemic status. For now, I've only
added the naming to the first stage below. I was also inspired by [lizbeth poirier](https://ritualdust.com/folklore/sigils/)'s sigil related work for the simple designs below.
