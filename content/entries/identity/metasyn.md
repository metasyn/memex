metasyn has been a name i've used since around 2006. _metasyn_ is a neologism,
a made up word. so, what does it mean?

# morpohology

## meta-

denoting: position after, along with, beyond, among, behind; second
order-kind; a change of condition or position; another subject that
analyzes the original one but at a more abstract, higher level;
something that consciously references or comments upon its own subject
or features;

_from Greek meta ‘with, across, or after’._

## -syn

united; acting or considered together;

_from Greek sun ‘with’._

# duality

so much of our life can be viewed in terms of duality. the day and night,
the heat and cold, the pain and joy in life. the name metasyn is meant to
representing coming to terms with what exists, moving beyond the dualities we
project and have been taught, or have otherwise come to believe in, and uniting
others in synthesis of shared understanding. the act of synthesizing existing
information into a new idea to me seems like the essence of creativity, and
maybe even humanity - it seems that we have some unique skills at doing this on
our planet.

# bad puns

there is a pun in there somewhere too - that this essential skill to our
definition is a "medicine" to the ailments and challenges we face as both
individuals and as a species.
