currently, i am primarily working on applied machine learning research, search
systems, and services that involve natural language processing. a large portion
of my job also involves etl, data pipelines, spark, and service reliability &
infrastructure related tasks. my professional skills are focused in the realm
of machine learning engineering and software engineering more generally. i am
comfortable programming in python, go, java, nim, and javascript, but in general,
love learning new languages and often do so just for fun.
