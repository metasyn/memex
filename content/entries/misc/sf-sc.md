# SF -> SC -> SF

let's go for a bike ride! below i've outlined a trip from San Francisco to Santa Cruz and back:

* duration: 3 full days
* length: ~ 150 miles
* elevation: ~ +8235 ft / -8435 ft

camping is just an option; instead, we could also stay at cheap hotels in half moon bay and santa cruz instead.


## day 1: SF -> Half Moon Bay

This day starts out in the city. After we get to Pacifica, we take a detour into a trail known as the "Planet of the Apes" (Thanks Myles!). It is kind of a winding
old road that has slowly deteriorated into a jungle, perfect for bikes but not for cars. It is really pretty and pops you out at Montara. From there, we'll ride more
straight forwardly to Half Moon bay where we'll stay.


### camping

* [Half Moon Bay State Beach](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=531)
    * this state park has a special section *just for cyclists* that can't be reserved!
    * we might not be the only ones there, but have a hard time imaging we'd get turned away

## day 2: Half Moon Bay -> Santa Cruz

From Half Moon bay, we have a bit of a longer, though flatter, ride all the way to Santa Cruz. The major de-"tour" ;) is the section between San Gregorio, through Pescadero,
and back to the highway. Though the rest of the ride is on the highway, thankfully there is a pretty big shoulder and the ride is pretty, looking over cliffs to the ocean.
The freeway takes us all the way into Santa Cruz proper.

### lodging

while there are lots of cool places to camp at Santa Cruz more generally, right now, i think this will be too last minute.
instead, we could just stay at a random hotel. alternatively, i could call up some friends and see if we can camp in their back yard ^__^


## day 3: Santa Cruz -> SF

I've never done this section of the ride, so I won't attempt to describe it outside of the fact that we're going over the hill, through Scott's Valley, and into San Jose.
From there, we'll take the Caltrain back to 4th and King in San Francisco and conclude the trip.
