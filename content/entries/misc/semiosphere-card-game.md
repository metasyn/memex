# semiosphere: a card game

my partner and i are currently working on designing a card game calle semiosphere. we aren't done designing it yet, so it may not be ready to play. it is heavily inspired by:

- [the illimat](https://www.illimat.com/) - designed by [keith baker](https://keith-baker.com/)
- [donsol](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/donsol.html) - designed by john eternal

## requirements

- the game is played with a standard 52 card deck

## concepts

the game is set in the [[semiosphere]]: the sphere of all signs, and their processes that operate with one another; the domain of all signs that contribute to and ultimately define a culture. there are four major influences at place in this psychic realm: _humanity_, _calamity_, _technology_, and _nature_. your goal is to collect _ideas_ (cards) from various _zones_ to build a cohesive _philosophy_.

### the influences

| suit     | name       | meaning and representation                                                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hearts   | humanity   | humanity as a whole                                                          |
| diamonds | calamity   | natural disasters, disease, famine, and crisis                               |
| spades   | technology | technology in the broadest sense: agriculture, writing, semiconductors, etc. |
| clovers  | nature     | flora, flauna, fungi                                                         |

### the actions

each turn, the player make take one of 3 conceptual actions:

| action    | description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| germinate | to introduce a new idea to the inhabitants of the zone       |
| incubate  | allow an idea to flourish and grow before your next turn     |
| culminate | synthesize an idea to its conclusion and add it to your PILE |

### the zones

the four influces lay across two axes:

- the axis of _humanity_ and _calamity_
- the axis of _technology_ and _nature_

as you play, these axes will flip, moving the zones around the board each time. where two influnces touch, they create a _zone_. all zones have one action restricted, except _the frontier_.

| zone         | cross-suits           | description | restriction     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| the frontier | technology & nature   | lorem       | no restrictions |
| the reprieve | humanity & nature     | lorem       | no incubation   |
| the artifice | technology & calamity | lorem       | no germination  |
| the torment  | humanity & calamity   | lorem       | no culmination  |

## setup

- separate the Ace cards and lay them so that:
  - _humanity_ is opposite _calamity_
  - _technology_ is opposite _nature_
- the intersection of two influences creates a _zone_

when setting up a board this way, it might look like:

<img src="resources/img/semiosphere-setup.png" style="width: 70%" />

it doesn't matter which cards are next to each other, as long as they're _opposite_ the right card. then:

- deal each player 4 cards
- deal 3 cards to each zone

now you are aready to start playing.

## gameplay

- play starts to the left of the dealer

## germination

## incubation

## culmination

# TODO

- reseed logic
- name of PILE
- scoring
