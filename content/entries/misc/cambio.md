# cambio

- cambio is a very fun 3-6 player game, based on memory and awareness
- cambio uses a standard 52 card deck
- you can read a good description of its rules [here](https://manito-wish.org/assets/Cambio-Rules.pdf)
- cambio is a great game because it is relatively easy to learn, but very hard to be consistently good at. there is a good mixture of luck, and the skill part of the game mostly has to do with speed, focus, and sometimes a little social trickery.
