# integrated circuits

as i go about learning more about synthesizers and [[ee]], i continue to come across various integrated circuits that i need to keep track of. below are my notes for particular components i'm working with.

# CMOS 4000 Series

* there are a lot of CMOS 4000 series ICs to do various things
* check [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_4000-series_integrated_circuits) for datasheets and descriptions

## CD4017BE

## CD4046BE

## C4015BE

## CD4056BE

## CD4093BE

* CMOS Quad 2-Input NAND Schmitt Triggers
