a few notes on a work-in-progress card game:

- the game is played with a standard 52 card deck
- each suit represents a concept
- each turn a player may take _one_ action

| suit     | name       | meaning and representation                                                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hearts   | humanity   | humanity as a whole                                                          |
| diamonds | calamity   | natural disasters, disease, famine, and crisis                               |
| spades   | technology | technology in the broadest sense: agriculture, writing, semiconductors, etc. |
| clovers  | nature     | flora, flauna, fungi                                                         |

| action    | description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| germinate | to introduce a new idea to the inhabitants of the zone       |
| incubate  | allow an idea to flourish and grow before your next turn     |
| culminate | synthesize an idea to its conclusion and add it to your PILE |

| zone         | cross-suits           | description | restriction     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| the frontier | technology & nature   | lorem       | no restrictions |
| the reprieve | humanity & nature     | lorem       | no incubation   |
| the artifice | technology & calamity | lorem       | no germination  |
| the torment  | humanity & calamity   | lorem       | no culmination  |

TODO:

- reseed logic
- name of PILE
- scoring
