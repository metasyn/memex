# degoogle

at one point, i realized how many different parts of my life were somehow
intertwined with google's services.  while i don't deny their usefulness, as
they saying goes, if you don't pay for the product, you are the product.  and i
started thinking more about how to actually move my data and usage off their
services. i'm far from being finished - because some of the services still make
sense for me to use. but i am attempting to at least slowly move my online self
off of their services. if you have particular suggestions, please do [[contact]]
me for how to continue getting off of google's services.

# successes

## gmail

i decided to start paying for encrypted mail at [protonmail](protonmail.com).
however, after having used my previous email at gmail for almost two decades,
the switch is far from being finished. but getting started is half done!

## google chrome

i use firefox for 99% of my personal browsing, but often am required to use
chrome for the occasional chrome-only website, or for work.

## google reader

haha, google already killed this product. i use [feedly](feedly.com).

# partials

## youtube

youtube has a clear monopoly on content, as well as content creators.
while there are tools like [invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/),
or [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) (which i use) - they only partially
disconnect you with the youtube platform itself.

i'm aware of [peertube](https://peer.tube/videos/trending?a-state=42) but
have not really found that there is a ton of content that i am after there.
often when i do find a video, the speeds are so poor its hard to use.
however i am happy to see the development's that [framasoft](https://framasoft.org/en/)
are making towards a [decentralized search](https://joinpeertube.org/) across
peertube instances.

## google search

i actually don't have a good replacement for this. i've been trying to use
[ecosia](ecosia.org) for a while, but for technical information, or hyper local
information, i find that google search is hard to beat. i'm ok with this for
the time being. i also tried using DuckDuckGo for quite some time, and still
use it sometimes, but am hoping that someday,
[we can do better than DuckDuckGo](https://drewdevault.com/2020/11/17/Better-than-DuckDuckGo.html).

## google maps

i tried using open street maps for android, and frankly, it is far from
comparable.  i still use google maps all the time. i would like to find a
reasonable alternative.  while open street maps works to some degree, it
doesn't really have the business information i often rely on google maps for. i
don't think there is a simple solution here yet for me.

# failures

## google fi

i use google fi for my phone plan. this one is easy to change, so i have been
putting it off.  for some reason, i'm not exactly sure why, i kind of care
about this one the least.

## google photos

google photos, hands down, is going to be the hardest service for me to
separate from. i've spent quite a bit of time looking at alternatives, but
simply organizing photos is such a royal pain imo.  however, out of all the
services, this is the one i'd like to tackle the most.
