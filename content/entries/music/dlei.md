# dlei

dlei was a song i made mostly on the digitakt and moog mother 32.

i was mostly interested in how i ended up parameter locking the filter
resonance and frequency to create that strange sound that occurs throughout the
song. i did a little compression in ableton afterwards to help with some maladjusted
levels.
